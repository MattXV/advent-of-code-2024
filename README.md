# Advent of Code 2024 ðŸŽ„

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! This is where Iâ€™ll be attempting to solve the daily programming challenges provided during the Advent of Code event.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Advent of Code?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a set of programming challenges that are released daily from December 1st to December 25th.

## ðŸ’» Tech

I've set off to use C++ and Python as I'd like to learn new C++23 features like ranges and views and keep my python sharp for problem solving tasks.

## :balance_scale: About this Repository

This repository contains my personal solutions to the 2024 challenges. It won't contain puzzle inputs, as per the rules of the challenge.
